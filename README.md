## 2. Machine Learning (ML)

### What is Machine Learning?
A subfield of AI where computers learn from data without explicit programming.

### Why Machine Learning?
It adapts over time and automates tasks like speech recognition and fraud detection.

**Example:** Amazon recommends products by analyzing user behavior.

---

## 3. What is Data?

### What is Data?
Raw facts and statistics; can be structured or unstructured.

### Why Data?
High-quality data is crucial for training accurate AI models.

**Example:** Facial recognition systems trained on labeled facial image datasets.

---

## 4. The Terminology of AI

- **Algorithm:** Steps to solve a problem.
- **Model:** Mathematical representation for predictions.
- **Neural Network:** Brain-inspired computing system.
- **Training Data:** Used to train models.
